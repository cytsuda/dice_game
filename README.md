# Dice games

A data game made with javascript.

This code is really simple, it is the most basic type of programming code possible. However, it helped me understand the basics of DOM manipulation.

The program basically generates two random numbers and compares to see which of the results is the largest. This all occurs while the page loads, so every time the page is refreshed the values are regenerated.
